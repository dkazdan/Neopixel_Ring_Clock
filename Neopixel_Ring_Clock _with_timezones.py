"""
Python code to run clock on ring of 60 NeoPixels.
Neopixel code must run in root.
? Sound needs to be off for GPIO18 ?
Started 12 September 2023
8 November 2023:
    Works pretty well.
    TODO: Add yellow background for sunup time, blue for moon up
29 December 2023:
    Corrected error in all-on hour computation
Clockpi5 built 12 February 2024
Needs Adafruit-blinka and Adafruit-neopixel.
Runs on Pi's time zone for now.
